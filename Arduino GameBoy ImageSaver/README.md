Improvements over the original code:

* Added alternative Arduino Code for Arduino UNO (the supplied Arduino Code didn't work on my Arduino UNO)
* Fixed BMP file header generation (resulting files can be opened in OS X/Linux and can be converted using ImageMagick)
* Improved path handling for Linux/OS X
* Added serial config (so we don't need to wait for it to scan all ports)
